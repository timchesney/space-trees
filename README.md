# Welcome to Space Trees

A basic Astro and Forestry starter (still very much a work in progress)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
